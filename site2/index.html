<h1>INDIA TOUR OF ENGLAND TEST MATCH</h1>
<p>The India cricket team are touring England in August and September 2021 to play five Test matches.Prior to their matches against England, India played New Zealand in the 2021 ICC World Test Championship Final at the Rose Bowl in Southampton in June 2021.[3] The Test series will be the first matches of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship.
In May 2021, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) made a request to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to adjust the schedule of the tour to accommodate the remaining matches of the 2021 Indian Premier League. However, a change would impact on tickets that have already been sold and the need to reschedule matches in The Hundred.
The first Test of the series ended in a draw, after more than two days of play was lost across the duration of the match to rain. India won the second Test by 151 runs, in the final hour of the fifth day, to take a 1–0 lead in the series. On the second day of the third Test, England players wore black armbands in remembrance of former England cricketer Ted Dexter, who died on 25 August 2021 due to illness. England went on to win the third Test by an innings and 76 runs before the lunch break on day four, levelling the series 1–1. It was Joe Root's 27th win as captain, the most by a captain of England in Test cricket</p>
